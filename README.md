API integration and data visualization using Python allow developers to fetch real-time data from public APIs, such as OpenWeatherMap, and present it in an insightful graphical format. By leveraging the requests library, data is retrieved and processed, while matplotlib  help create visually appealing charts. This approach is widely used for analyzing weather trends, stock prices, or social media insights. Data visualization enhances decision-making by transforming raw information into understandable graphics, such as line charts, bar graphs, or scatter plots. This combination of API integration and visualization makes data-driven applications more interactive, informative, and user-friendly.
